# High-Value-Customer-Recognition

The High Value Customer Recognition project aims to help sales teams identify and prioritize high-value customers based on purchasing history. By using a predictive model, this project enables sales teams to focus resources on customers who provide the most potential value, ultimately supporting strategic decision-making, improving time management, and boosting revenue.

###Motivation
As a former salesperson, I often interacted with countless engineers from various US corporations, each with unique product development needs. I wished I could address all of their issues and create tailored solutions, but time constraints made it impossible. I always wanted a way to identify which clients in my department could bring the most value, so we could finally reach our quota (which often felt nearly impossible, by the way).

If I had a tool like this project that presented a prioritized list of high-value clients each morning, it would have been a game-changer. This kind of insight would allow me to prioritize my time effectively, rather than focusing on clients simply because they were from more well-known companies.
